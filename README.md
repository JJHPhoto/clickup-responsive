# ClickUp Responsive

Mini-project for ClickUp job applicaiton. I need to make a responsive version of a webpage they sent me a Figma demo of.

## Workflow

- Whiteboard & grab graphics/colors.
- Create Repo & initial files
- Start testing grid
- CSS the colors of navbar as well as working on collapsable menu
- realized i was using bootstrap classes; w3 schools for responsive navbar
- found font family
- responsive menu working
- divided up grid areas
- class vs id
- get things looking close on page
- need to decided between flex and float?
- figured out feature card backgrounds.
- responsive navbar with flex
