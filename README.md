# [ClickUp Responsive](https://jjhphoto.github.io/clickup-responsive/)

This is a mini-project that I received from ClickUp as part of their job interview process. I had a lot of fun figuring out all the CSS to get this to be responsive as requested in the brief.

## Workflow

The first thing I did after recieving the brief was to try to write up all the tasks I thought I needed to complete this project. The funny thing was I was using ClickUp to make the tasks. I then whiteboarded the prorject with a good friend who has been helpful in my web development path.

I initially tried writing the app using CSS gridboxes but ended up switching to flexbox after having a number of spacing difficulties. Once I got everything on the page, I started working on making it look as close as possible for the desktop view.

After that, it was a matter of trying to get each section to be responsive. This proved to be harder than I thought. I dug around on W3 Schools, CSS-Tricks, etc to find ways to get each section looking good in responsive. I really liked how well flexbox did this naturally in most areas. I then added media queries to get certain things to fit a bit better at smaller screens.
